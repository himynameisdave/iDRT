###*intellegent Durham Regional Transit*


A simple mobile web app for finding and viewing a DRT bus schedule quickly and easily.

Still currently in development.

UI designed by [Miguel Lovery](http://mjlphotos.tumblr.com/). Built by [Dave Lunny](http://himynameisdave.github.io/) (me!). This is an L+L collaboration.

#####You can see a [demo by clicking right here](http://himynameisdave.github.io/iDRT/#/).

***Note:*** 
*Usually you are only able to view the app on a mobile device, however for the development version the only requirement is that you view it in a window that is no wider or higher than 767px. Resize your browser window and refresh until it shows up.*

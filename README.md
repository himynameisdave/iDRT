*A simple mobile web app for finding and viewing a DRT bus schedule quickly and easily.*

Okay, let's be honest, the [Durham Regional Transit schedule lookup](https://www.durhamregiontransit.com/Pages/Bus%20Schedule%20PDF%20Format.aspx) is horrible. Those stupid little ![icon](https://www.durhamregiontransit.com/Maps/PublishingImages/viewSchedule.gif) icons!? Terrible, especially when you're out waiting for the bus and you need to lookup the schedule on a mobile device. Since the DRT as you know is run by a bunch of monkeys, we've decided to cut out the middle man and created a simple way to lookup schedules quickly when you're out waiting for the bus.


This is an L+L collaboration: 
- UI designed by [Miguel Lovery](http://mjlphotos.tumblr.com/)
- Built by [Dave Lunny](http://himynameisdave.github.io/) (me!)

**Still currently in development, use with caution:**
#####You can see a [demo by clicking right here](http://himynameisdave.github.io/iDRT/#/).

***Note:*** 
*Usually you are only able to view the app on a mobile device, however for the development version the only requirement is that you view it in a window that is no wider or higher than 767px. Resize your browser window and refresh until it shows up.*

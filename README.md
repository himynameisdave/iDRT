A simple app to quickly look up bus schedules &amp; maps for Durham Regional Transit buses.



You want a demo? Okay it'll be here as I'm building it. It's SHIT right now, and will not work if your browser window is > 767px in either width or height (later there is going to be a better check, also we need to design a desktop site):
